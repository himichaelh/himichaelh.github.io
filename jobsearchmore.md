# My Job Search Process

The next few months will be really interesting, as I slowly figure out things post graduation.

I wrote down a few things about my process. I hope they can align my day-to-day actions with my long-term goals. It's less about job searching and more about growing as a person, contributing to a team that I admire, and doing things that I respect. 

I prefer authenticity and have faith on the other end, so I refuse to put flowery language in any job application just to polish my image. I want to be authentic and honest with anyone who views my job application.

## Beyond The Resume

I think a resume doesn't say much about a person. When I help friends with their resumes, I see a clear gap between who they are as a person (e.g. personality and lifestyle) and what they write on their resumes. Even with the accomplishments as bullet points, we have no idea about the story and costs behind doing so much. I can only imagine how the readers (managers/recruiters) feel when they have to go through hundreds of applications! I try to make my resume straightforward, but there is only so much I can do on that front.

Cover letters address that issue somewhat, but there is always a limit to knowing someone with limited information. I always attach a cover letter because I want to respect the other side. If you take time to read my application, I ought to tell you more than my internships, my college name, and a few bullet points that take years of work to be included (for example, native level in Mandarin Chinese or proficiency in R and statistics).

Having a conversation would certainly help. The downside is the interview format will likely restrain the candidate. I sometimes feel nervous or overly conscientious to express myself authentically. And Zoom doesn't help either!

The ideal is to know a candidate for an extended period, but that is not always feasible. For example, how does a student find out about a manager and a team, when such information may not be available online? And considering how busy people are, it may not be possible for working adults to really get to know a student. Good results here rely largely on serendipity and active efforts on both fronts.

The best thing I can do for anyone reading my job application is to tell you enough about myself. By enough I don't mean pages of my life story in a cover letter. Your time is valuable, but you can find more information in various URLs if you are interested. Not every entry position can start with a portfolio, but writing in detail is the closest version I can imagine. Projects are bonus good things I want to show you, these mini essays are really the core.

If time and energy permits (given academics and personal life), I enjoy doing interesting projects, but that isn't always feasible. I have researched off-the-cuff Chinese investment funds for a fund advisor in New York. I have done market research and community building for a fintech startup in China. I have done bookkeeping for small businesses (starting with my mother's store). I have translated for tourists and conference attendees alike. The list goes on. You won't know about them, because I don't list them on my resume. They are just things I do on the side. I always learn from such experience, but they are not sustained efforts I do on a regular basis. My Chinese and English blogs are the only things I do consistently outside of school and personal life. I actually enjoy writing and learning via writing.

If you are still interested, please read on. I will walk you through how I've thought about job searching, work, and my principles. I believe knowing this much about me beforehand is a plus. You will probably know if I deserve an interview by looking at this (and I certainly hope the answer is yes!). And I handle rejection quite well, because I know I am not the most qualified candidates for every position by definition.

## Michael's Process

We often ask questions in the order of what, how, and occasionally why. What jobs should I apply to? How should I apply? And for some candidates, why should I apply to this job?

I find that a bit odd, because answering the why question is so important that it should be first. So my order is altered with why, what, and how. Why am I choosing this path? Why am I living my current life with this habit, routine, and value? How do I align myself with what is available out there? How should I approach this job seeking process? I can go all-in on specific positions and teams only when I can at least answer these questions somewhat.

If there is one thing you should know about the way I work, it's that I go all-in on whatever I have to do. As someone who ran cross country in high school, I believe in putting my full effort to what's ahead of me and then rest fully. Half-ass is not acceptable. In case for frustrating situation (e.g. bureaucracy), I still try my best to sprint the important parts.

## Why am I choosing this path? Why am I living my current life with this habit, routine, and value? 

I usually answer the first question in my cover letter and the second in private. It's not something I eagerly share in the open for privacy reasons. Of course, I am always happy to talk about them during conversation.

There is a basic premise behind the first question. I need to clarify whose work I am doing. I am certainly providing for my family (and community by extension), but that is not the entire reason. I also have personal reasons. When I picture my 20s as a high school senior, I imagine someone who shows up everyday (courtesy of doing marching band and cross country for years), pushing through tough challenges (some of which one may never consider beforehand), absorbing the experience like a sponge, and feeling accomplished. It may sound corny, but a sense of mission matters to my morale and fulfillment. That's why I  really value a company's culture, especially the team I will join. Team members will influence one another, so it's important to be upfront about that.

An extension to the why question is working at places that keep people and let them grow for the long term. I admire them the most because they take a chance in raw talent and let them flourish. There is something special about a world class team not pieced together by spending a fortune to hire the already best. In video games, the most inspiring stories are friends who climb together, not superstars forming a team. From what I know, Vanguard, Costco, Berkshire Hathaway, and In-N-Out are some prominent examples.

I want to become really good. The best way to improve in tennis is to rally with someone better than you. By taking their time, they essentially invest in you. Passing that forward is something I want to do for as long as I live. It's not about  money. My mother tells me to "do the right thing with the right people and the money will come". I can't imagine a different way of living.

## How do I align myself with what is available out there? How should I approach this job seeking process? 

I see two common approaches to job search among my friends. Some apply to many positions and hope to land a few interviews. Some apply to a good number of positions and try to make use of their resources, such as alumni connections and school names. I don't think the former way works. And I cannot compete with competent people who have more resources. That's the reality.

So I want to be deliberate instead.

With more digitization in the job market, I cannot win against algorithms with my resume no matter how much I polish it. I believe a person will read my application on the other side. That means I want to deserve their valuable time and attention. I research each organization, its business/work, and its culture. That is the least I can do, aside from spelling the names correctly.

## What am I looking for? 

[Shreyas Doshi](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1306640960282001408), a great mentor I never met, shared several things to consider.

One, high caliber people. You become better in tennis by rallying with people. Life is a journey, so it's best to enjoy it with great people. I want to be like Ash Ketchum, who makes Pokemon a great story largely due to his friendship with people and his Pokemons.

Two, a growing field. Rising tide lifts all boats. I don't mind smaller boats, if they fit me better.

Three, accepting or even encouraging generalist learning. The norm is to go deep and specialize, but I want to go wide for a little longer. I don't want to box myself in too early, because my commitment tendency will kick in too quickly. Reading David Epstein's Range is a great reminder on why I switched my major from history to mathematics. In addition, there are many things only generalists can handily approach, because the real world is messy.

While the three criterion are helpful, I mostly look at number one. The other two are not required. 

I also believe in serendipity and kindness, even if it sounds awkward on paper. This is my gut-check question: can I make my teammates happy with my efforts? I want to contribute positively or it isn't fair for everyone else in the team. In addition, many people have helped me to get to where I already am. I want to pay that forward.

## Succinct Thoughts On Work 

Below are some things I stand by, when it comes to work. They may be repeats from before, but that's not a bad thing.

I want to be authentic. I want to be at an environment that encourages honesty and sincerity.

I prefer feedback over nicety. If there are things you can tell me to make me better, please tell me so. Improvement is always the better choice in the long run.

I learn and adapt quickly. To do that, I will ask many questions in a short period of time to make sense of things I do not know well.

I try to use my best hours for deep work. That benefits my team the most.

I am curious about things that may be irrelevant to my current work. That may often seem counterproductive, but the results may be more interesting than expected.
