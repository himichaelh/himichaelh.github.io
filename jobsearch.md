# My Job Search Principles

Here are some ideas on my job search process and lessons I learned from working in internships, projects, and life in general. Thank you for reading this.

## General Principles

Job searching is not really about job searching. It is more about self-understanding, growing as a person, contributing to a team that I admire, and doing things that I respect. 

No matter where I go and what I do, I want to align my day-to-day actions with my long-term values and goals. 

It's not about money. My mother tells me to "do the right thing with the right people and the money will come". I can't imagine a different way of living.

If there is one thing you should know about the way I work, it's that I go all-in on whatever I do.

As someone who ran cross country in high school, I believe in putting my full effort to what's ahead of me and then rest fully. Half-ass is not acceptable. 

I want to become really really good at whatever I am doing, even if it’s something niche like understanding how to create a better online payment experience for Korean customers. 

Two things I know I will relentlessly work on no matter what – writing and communications. Writing shows clarity of thought. Communication shows how well you can work with people.

I believe in serendipity and kindness. To start, I believe a human is reading my application on the other end, so I want to deserve their valuable time and attention. 

Sincerity matters and actions speak loudly than words.

Many people have helped me to get to where I already am. I want to pay that forward.

I want to be authentic. I want to be at an environment that encourages honesty and sincerity.

I prefer feedback over nicety. If there are things you can tell me to make me better, please tell me so. Improvement is always the better choice in the long run.

I learn and adapt quickly. To do that, I will ask many questions in a short period of time to make sense of things I do not know well.

I try to use my best hours for deep work. That helps my team the most.

I am curious about things that may be irrelevant to my current work. That may often seem counterproductive, but the results may be more interesting than expected.

Even though I wrote this over a span of two weeks, it took me actually a few years to really understand these principles and feel confident about them.

## Beyond A Resume

I think a resume doesn't say much about a person for many reasons. There is only so much I can do in terms of writing a resume.

I always attach a cover letter because I want to respect the other side’s time and attention. The best thing I can do for anyone reading my job application is to tell you enough about myself. I believe knowing this much about me beforehand is a plus. 

Your time is valuable, so I won’t write pages of life stories. The more detailed version will be in various links for anyone interested. 

Not every entry position applicant has a portfolio but writing in detail may be the closest version to that I can imagine. I also think there is no standard portfolio, because no two people think and do one thing exactly the same.

I enjoy doing interesting projects, but it isn’t always doable due to time and energy constraints. My Chinese and English blogs are the only projects I consistently do, since I enjoy writing and learning via writing. 

I handle rejection quite well, because I know I am not the most qualified candidates for every position. We are all looking for the best match and there is much more to that than one’s qualifications.

## Michael’s Thought Process

We often ask questions in the order of what, how, and sometimes why. I find that odd because answering the why question is so important that it should be first. My order is instead why, how and what. 

Why am I choosing this path? Why am I living my current life with this habit, routine, and value? I answer the first question in the cover letter and the second question in private. The premise behind the first question is I work to support my family and my community, but it’s also personal. 

When I pictured my 20s as a high school senior, I imagine someone who shows up every day, push through challenges, absorb experiences like a sponge, and feel accomplished. 

It may sound corny, but my morale and fulfillment are based on a sense of mission. That’s why I value a company’s culture and the team I will join. Team members will influence one another, so it's important to think about it upfront.

How do I align myself with what is available out there? How should I approach this job seeking process? I research each organization, its business/work, and its culture. That is the least I can do, aside from spelling the names correctly.

What am I looking for? [Shreyas Doshi](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1306640960282001408), a great mentor who I never met, has really good insights.

One, high caliber people. You become better in tennis by rallying with people. Life is a journey, so it's best to enjoy it with great people. I want to be like Ash Ketchum, who makes Pokémon a great story due to his friendship with people and his Pokémon.

Two, a growing field. Rising tide lifts all boats. I don't mind smaller boats, if they fit me better.

Three, accepting or even encouraging generalist learning. I don’t want to box myself in too early, because flexibility is good for long-term growth (both for myself and my organization). It has to do with how I perform optimally, which is taking the most interesting and important bits from whatever I can find. Over time that leads to a decent breadth of knowledge and skills. 

Of course, I want to go deep on a few extra interesting things – my Pokémon attribute graph will look more like a round shape with a few sharp spikes. 

In addition, there are problems generalists can better tackle due to the messiness of the real world. 

I have one final gut-check question: can I make my teammates happy with my efforts? I don’t want people to put up with me. That feels unfair for everyone else. The best team feels comfortable working together and conflict resolution is prompt and easy to do. Simplicity is best.
