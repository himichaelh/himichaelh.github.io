## Hi, I'm Michael He

I live in Los Angeles. I am a math major, but I spend too much time learning about random things. For example, investing, business, China, food, fermentation, anime, jazz, Bach, ... I haven't made up my mind on most things in the world.

I recently started coding. It's been fun so far.

You can email me [here](mailto:michaelhe@hey.com).
You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hi_michaelh).

### Brief Bio

I grew up in Shanghai. I have been in California since 2011. I love In-N-Out.

### Blogs and Essays

I write my blog posts on [HEY World](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/). I process my thoughts there. You can also get a glimpse of my [Chinese blog here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIxMzg5Mjk0Mg==&mid=2247484458&idx=1&sn=3919d7831550a91998766663b3924109&chksm=97aeae0ba0d9271dd1f2ff48135929f4d24dacce95eec0f149913be991bbedb73561de769791&token=1805372847&lang=zh_CN#rd).

Until I feel confident to publish essays (permanently), I won't include any. Please read Paul Graham's excellent essay on [writing great essays](http://paulgraham.com/useful.html) instead.

### Bookshelf

I will upload book reviews in the future. For now, see my recent reads and favorites [here](https://www.zeneca.io/michaelhe).

I have some books that are impossible to throw out:
* The Analects
* Poor Charlie's Almanack
* Warren Buffett's Letters to Shareholders
* Books by Seneca

Go read some books. It's fun.
