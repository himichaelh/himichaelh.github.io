## Hi, I'm Michael He

I live in Los Angeles. I am a math major at Pomona College. 

My top priorities is becoming a better listener. My favorite things are Bach, jazz, food, manga, walking, dogs, business/investing, tennis (beginner), Chinese culture (including cheesy drama), economic growth, reading and writing. 

I'd love to get your email [here](mailto:michaelhe@hey.com) or at michaelhe@hey.com. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hi_michaelh) at @hi_michaelh.

If you find my writing or work interesting, please consider sharing with people and email/DM me! I'd love to hear from you. Since some people asked me, I have set up $heymichaelhe as my Cash App account. 

### Writing

I began writing my [blog](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/) in early 2021. It's been an [incredible experience so far](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/240-days-later-5280bc41). If you find it interesting, please subscribe. It means a lot to me!

### Brief Bio

I spent the first half of my life in Shanghai and the second half in California. One day I will write about [my early life story like this](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1025089196292157440?lang=en). My most formative years are indeed formative.

Traveling and reading are two great ways to learn about this world. I'm fortunate to do both at quite an early age. Going to Tokyo gave me the first taste of freedom, visiting the Bay Area showed me how driven and smart people can get, and living in Hawaii taught me the importance of culture, care, and gratitude. 

By the way, I'm a big In-N-Out fan! I usually order a cheeseburger with grilled onions, some well-done animal styled fries, and free iced water. Inflation may screw us over in the long run, but at least In-N-Out is keeping a delicious filling meal under ten bucks!

As a humanities turned STEM major, I never imagined to learn to code. But here I am, writing one line after another on R Studio and VS Code! I'm not passionate about coding _just yet_, but I'd love to do more software development and bridge the digital world to the physical world, especially those "unglamorous" aspects (think agriculture, logistics, and mundane work). My story of becoming a math major is also quite representative of my life so far - learning whatever that interests me at the time while staying curious for other things. 

This past summer I worked at NPR's [Planet Money Indicator podcast](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money). I learned a lot, especially the joy of working with and learning from high caliber people. I was fortunate to contribute to and produce several stories, such as this one on [BTS](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/28/1021968141/bts-the-band-that-moves-the-economy), [anime](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/30/1042060699/japanese-anime-made-in-china), [China antitrust](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/25/1031074795/chinas-big-tech-crackdown) and Stripe Atlas (please stay tuned). Give them a listen!

### Bookshelf

I don't think I read that much, but I certainly spend a lot of money on books. My friends think I'm addicted and I agree. 

Here are some in-depth book reviews I've written:
* Range
* Influence
* Zero to One
* How Innovation Works
* War of Art
* Battle Royale
* Growth

I have also made a few guides/pdfs to some great books:
* All of the above
* Poor Charlie's Almanack (talk by talk)
* The Goal
* Atomic Habits
* How To Lie With Statistics
* Prime Movers of Globalization

It's time to read more. It's the funnest thing, aside from playing with pets, sleeping, and spending time with my loved ones.
