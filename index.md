## Hi, I'm Michael He

I live in Los Angeles and study at Pomona College. I am a math major, but I spend too much time on learning about random things. For example, investing, running businesses, thinking about China, all kinds of food, fermentation, anime, jazz, Bach...

I recently started coding. It's been fun so far. 

My email is at michaelhe@hey.com
You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hi_michaelh).

### Brief Bio

I grew up in Shanghai. I have been in California since 2011. That's about it. 

### Essays

I write regularly on [HEY World](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/). I process my unpolished thinking there. You can also get a glimpse of my long-running [Chinese blog here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIxMzg5Mjk0Mg==&mid=2247484458&idx=1&sn=3919d7831550a91998766663b3924109&chksm=97aeae0ba0d9271dd1f2ff48135929f4d24dacce95eec0f149913be991bbedb73561de769791&token=1805372847&lang=zh_CN#rd)

Until I feel certain to publish essays, I won't include any links on here yet. Please read Paul Graham's excellent essay on [writing great essays](http://paulgraham.com/useful.html).
