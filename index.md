## Hi, I'm Michael He
I live in Los Angeles. I am a student at Pomona College studying mathematics and statistics. My story of becoming a math major is quite representative of my life so far - learning whatever that interests me at the time without giving up curiosity for the others. 

I'm working on two important things: becoming a better listener and don't form opinions on most things just yet. 

My favorite things include Bach, jazz (especially cool), food in general, manga/manhwa/manhua, walking, playing with my friends' dogs, learning about businesses and investing, playing tennis as a beginner, anything related to China, studying economic growth, and reading and writing. 

I'd love to get your email [here](mailto:michaelhe@hey.com) or michaelhe@hey.com. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hi_michaelh). Unfortuantely, someone claimed @michaelhe already. 

### Writing

I began writing my English blog on [HEY World](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/) in early 2021. It's been an [incredible experience](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/240-days-later-5280bc41). If you find it interesting, please subscribe! It means a lot.

I will include some of my favorite pieces here:

* [Why Kids Hate Writing](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/why-kids-hate-writing-0df7b6ad), retweeted by Paul Graham and Jason Fried
* [Stop Being Jealous Of WeChat](https://michaelhe.me/wechat)
* Getting My Hands Dirty
* [Michael's SGV Eating Guide](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/michael-s-guide-to-eat-in-the-sgv-dbb47e8d)
* [The Never-Ending Writing Quest](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/the-never-ending-writing-quest-6fed781f)
* The Trust Battery
* My College Education Is Worth It
* Squid Game Christianity
* Some College Lessons

I am writing my senior thesis on mathematical growth. I'd love to share more details you soon.

### Brief Bio

I spent the first half of my life in Shanghai and the second half in California. One day I will write about [my early story in this fashion](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1025089196292157440?lang=en). 

Traveling and reading are two ways to learn about this world. I'm privileged to do both at an early age. Traveling to Tokyo gave me a taste of freedom and exploration, visiting the Bay Area showed me how driven and smart people can get, and living in Hawaii taught me the importance of culture, care, and gratitude. 

By the way, I'm a big In-N-Out fan! I usually order a cheeseburger with grilled onions, some well-done animal styled fries, and free iced water. Inflation may screw us over, but at least In-N-Out keeps a filling meal under ten bucks!

This past summer I worked at NPR's [Planet Money Indicator podcast](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money). I learned a lot from working there, especially the joy of being with high caliber colleagues. I was fortunate to contribute and produce several stories, such as this one on [BTS](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/28/1021968141/bts-the-band-that-moves-the-economy), [anime](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/30/1042060699/japanese-anime-made-in-china), and one more on Stripe Atlas. Stay tuned!

As a humanities turned STEM student, I never imagined to learn to code. But here I am, writing one line after another on R Studio! I'm not passionate about coding _yet_, but I'd love to become more involved with software development and bridging the digital world to the physical world, especially those "unglamorous" parts.

### Bookshelf

I don't think I read that much, but I certainly spend a lot of money on books. My friends think I'm addicted. 

Here are some in-depth book reviews I've written:
* Range
* Influence
* Zero to One
* How Innovation Works
* War of Art
* Battle Royale
* Dark Ages Ahead
* Growth

I have also made a few guides/pdfs to some of my favorite books:
* Poor Charlie's Almanack
* Influence
* The Goal
* Atomic Habits
* How To Lie With Statistics
* Prime Movers of Globalization

Time to read more. It's fun.
