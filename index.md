## Hi, I'm Michael He

I live in Los Angeles. I am a math major at Pomona College graduating in May 2022. The most current trivia is I enjoy the struggles in learning Classic Greek, whose verbs have seven tenses, four moods, three voices, three persons, and three numbers. 

My favorite things includes classical music, kpop (BTS, TXT, and IU), jazz (esp. 1950s), manga, dogs, and tennis. I spend a lot of free time learning and thinking about business, investing, history, economcis, technology, pop culture, and all things China.

### Seeking 

I am actively seeking work. Some of you are here because I included an URL in the job application. Thank you for taking the time to visit this duct-taped website. 

I want to be upfront. LinkedIn and resume do not say everything (especially the intangile things), so I wrote a [supplement here](https://michaelhe.me/jobsearch).

I highly value a company's culture, especially the team I will be working with. I am a big believer in "do the right thing with the right people and the money will come", which my mom says all the time. 

I have followed Vanguard, Stripe, Shopify, and Costco for many years starting as a customer. As I learned more about each company, I feel energized thinking of a potential future at each place. This invariably sets a high bar (given the competitiveness of the hiring process), but it aspires me to work hard no matter what happens.

I worked at NPR's [Planet Money Indicator podcast](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money) in summmer 2021. The most important lesson learned was the joy of working with high caliber people. During that time, I gradually handled things beyond the initial job description. This taught me a lot about teamwork, journalism, getting things done, and the benefits of being a generalist. I was fortunate to produce/guest appear on several episodes, including [BTS](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/28/1021968141/bts-the-band-that-moves-the-economy), [anime](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/30/1042060699/japanese-anime-made-in-china), [China antitrust](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/25/1031074795/chinas-big-tech-crackdown) and Stripe Atlas (stay tuned). Please give them a listen!

Similarly, I really enjoy my [TA experience](https://michaelhe.me/pomonata) in math and Mandarin at Pomona College. It is not easy to become aware of subtle nuances over subjects you know, which you then have to explain to people in a way they can understand. The experience also exposes how different we learn, handle challenges, and work together. I will have a lot of fond moments to remember about my time in college.

If you want to know why I went from a history major to studying mathematics, here is a [brief story[(https://michaelhe.me/switchingmajor)]. The caveat is even though I study STEM now, I am still very much in love with humanities. For example, I am taking Classical Greek, Italian, and piano this semester in addition to my math seminars.

### Projects

I enjoy random projects. They are fun. We all need a little bit of fun on top of the daily grind. I am working on the following things right now. Progress will be updated every month. 

I have two long-term projects:
* [Chinese blog](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIxMzg5Mjk0Mg==&mid=2247484627&idx=1&sn=ab016fed61e0c77cca82fbcdf51387c4&chksm=97aeaef2a0d927e40c0c108c7d2a1722107e82b605f2e0519822e06feb21bcb53658b2f9bbb1&token=470111712&lang=zh_CN#rd) on Wechat (michaelscorner); I started in summer 2019 and it's been growing steadily since then, now close to 1000 readers. 
* [English blog](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/); I started in Spring 2021 and it currently has sixty-plus posts that I feel comfortable sharing. Some particularly good ones will end up here.

I also have some medium and short-term projects (which I rotate based on current interests): 
* Statistical analysis on scientific progress, [the hosting service](https://michaelhe.shinyapps.io/citationgames/?_ga=2.159348730.1354829746.1643606999-1388533146.1643606999) may currently be buggy, so here is a link to [my repository](https://github.com/himichaelhe/citationgames). You can run the files in RStudio (which is free to download) while I try to fix the issue with the hosting service. I am writing a companion essay on this topic due summer 2022.
* A primer on mathematical growth curves. I will release individual chapters in the next several weeks, starting with exponential growth and ending with fractal growth. There will likely be "explainer" blog posts on each concept I find interesting and relevant to our daily lives.
* My love for See's Candies, which leads me to trace the business history, management, and [financial data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12RgKTHFlFf_Bj8IS3gGPwYSwxKyI41M6c7fYyZ78phQ/edit?usp=sharing). 
* A secret project on K-pop with some of the biggest fan accounts on Twitter (who are beyond supportive for what I have in mind).

Once I complete my senior thesis, I will have more time to dabble with web dev, Rails, and Python. They are things I really want to learn, but cannot focus given my current commitments.

### Writing

I started a [blog](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/) in March 2021. It's been an [incredible experience](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/240-days-later-5280bc41). Please share with people if you like it. It means a lot to me!

You can find my favorite posts from 2021 [here](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/2021-top-posts-68f6875f). The good news is 2022 will be even better, because I'm slowly finding my mojo. Writing what you want to write is really fun. I wish more people can give it a try. 

Here are some of my favorite pieces that survived my friend/editor Samuel's scruitny: 

* [Why Kids Hate Writing](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/why-kids-hate-writing-0df7b6ad)

* [Fast And Thoughtful](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/fast-and-thoughtful-aa453b11)

I will probably write more about college, language learning, k-pop, and books I love in the foreseeable future. Please stay tuned!

### Bio

I spent my childhood in Shanghai and moved to California in 6th grade. I'd love to share some of those stories if you are interested. At some point I will write down a few traveling experiences that changed me for the better. You can read my other reflections here: NPR, college, and switching majors. 

P.S: I love In-N-Out. 

### Bookshelf

There are more books than I can ever finish. It's both a blessing and a curse. 

Here are books I want to [reread](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/start-rereading-38c867e9). They have shaped my thinking process in various ways.

* Poor Charlie's Almanack: the life operating system
* Range: the benefits of being a generalist
* Influence: the best way to operate as a human being
* Zero to One: how to think for yourself
* The Evolution of Everything: the bigger forces in the world
* The Four Loves: the value of friendship and kindness
* The Power Broker: on hubris, on genius, and on human nature
