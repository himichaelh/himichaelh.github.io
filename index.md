## Hi, I'm Michael He

I live in Los Angeles. I am a math major at Pomona College, graduating in May 2022. My current priority is figuring out things post graduation. 

A non-exhaustive list of my favorite things includes classical music (esp. Bach), jazz (esp. 1950s), kpop (BTS, TXT, and IU), manga, dogs, business, investing, tennis, history, economics, and all things China (it's so nuanced). 

Email my [personal email](mailto:michaelhe@hey.com) or [school email](mailto:young.he@pomona.edu) here. My Twitter handle is @himichaelhe. My GitHub is @himichaelhe.

### Seeking 

I am actively seeking work. Some of you are here because I put this link in the job application. Thank you for taking the time. 

I want to be upfront. LinkedIn and resume do not say much about important yet intangible things (e.g. here), so I wrote a [supplement here](https://michaelhe.me/jobsearch). I prefer authenticity and good faith on the other end, so I refuse to put flowery language in any job application.

I highly value a company's culture, especially the team I will be working with. I am a big believer in the saying "do the right thing with the right people and the money will come". 

I have followed Vanguard, Stripe, Shopify, and Spotify for many years. I was their customer first. As I learned about each company, I came to see a potential future with each place. It is good to set a high bar because it aspires me to work hard no matter what happens.

I worked at NPR's podcast division in summmer 2021. I learned a lot and realized the joy of working with high caliber people. I handled things beyond the job description yet somehow still within my zone of competence. It taught me a lot about teamwork, journalism, and benefits being a generalist. 

Similarly, I enjoy my TA work at Pomona College, helping students with math and Mandarin Chinese. If you want to know why I went from a humanities student to study mathematics, here is a brief story.

### Projects

I enjoy random projects. They offer something fun to work on, instead of the daily grind of problem sets. I am working on the following, with updates every few weeks. 

* [Chinese blog](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIxMzg5Mjk0Mg==&mid=2247484627&idx=1&sn=ab016fed61e0c77cca82fbcdf51387c4&chksm=97aeaef2a0d927e40c0c108c7d2a1722107e82b605f2e0519822e06feb21bcb53658b2f9bbb1&token=470111712&lang=zh_CN#rd) on Wechat (michaelscorner); I started in summer 2019 and it's been growing steadily since then. 
* [English blog](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/); I started in Spring 2021 and it currently has sixty-plus posts that I feel comfortable sharing.
* Statistical analysis on science progress, [the hosting service](https://michaelhe.shinyapps.io/citationgames/?_ga=2.159348730.1354829746.1643606999-1388533146.1643606999) may be buggy at times. I am writing a companion essay on this topic due before summer 2022.
* A primer on mathematical growth. I shall be releasing individual chapters in the next several weeks.
* My love for See's Candies, which leads me to trace the business history, management, and financial data. 

This past summer I worked at NPR's [Planet Money Indicator podcast](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money). I was fortunate to produce several episodes, including [BTS](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/28/1021968141/bts-the-band-that-moves-the-economy), [anime](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/30/1042060699/japanese-anime-made-in-china), [China antitrust](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/25/1031074795/chinas-big-tech-crackdown) and Stripe Atlas (stay tuned). Please give them a listen.

### Bio

I spent my childhood in Shanghai and moved to California in 6th grade. I'd love to share some of those stories if you are interested. For more on my traveling experience, click here. I love In-N-Out. You can read my other reflections here: NPR, college, and switching majors. 

### Bookshelf

I spend too much money and not enough time on books. There are more books than I can ever finish. It's both a blessing and a curse.

Here are books I want to [reread](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/start-rereading-38c867e9). They have shaped my worldview.

* Poor Charlie's Almanack: the life operating system
* Range: the benefits of being a generalist
* Influence: the best way to operate as a human being
* Zero to One: how to think for yourself
* The Evolution of Everything: the bigger forces in the world
* The Four Loves: the value of friendship and kindness
