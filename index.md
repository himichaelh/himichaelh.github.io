## Hi, I'm Michael He

I live in Los Angeles. I am a math major at Pomona College graduating in May 2022. The most current trivia is I enjoy the struggles in learning Classic Greek, whose verbs have seven tenses, four moods, three voices, three persons, and three numbers. 

My favorite things includes classical music, kpop (BTS, TXT, IU, and Epik High), jazz (esp. 1950s), manga, dogs, and tennis. I spend a lot of free time learning and thinking about business, history, economics, technology, pop culture, investing, and all things China. Of course, I spend time to read about faith every morning (5 psalms a day keeps the evil away).

I went from a history major to studying mathematics and never looked back. I will write about that before graduation. Even though I study STEM now, I am still very much in love with humanities. For example, I am taking Classical Greek, Italian, and piano this semester in addition to my math seminars.

### Seeking 

I am actively seeking work. Some of you are here because I included an URL in the job application. Thank you for taking the time to visit this duct-taped website. 

I want to be upfront. LinkedIn and resume do not say everything about a person (especially the intrinsic qualities), so I wrote a [supplement here](https://michaelhe.me/jobsearch). You can also read some of my principles [here](https://michaelhe.me/lifemanual).

I highly value a company's culture, especially the team I will be working with. I am a big believer in "do the right thing with the right people and the money will come", which my mom says all the time. 

I have followed Stripe, Shopify, Vanguard, and Costco for many years. Each company teaches me to focus on the people: users for Stripe, merchants for Shopify, clients for Vanguard, and members for Costco. This invariably sets a high bar (given the competitiveness of the hiring process), but it also aspires me to work hard no matter the outcome.

I worked at NPR's [Planet Money Indicator podcast](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money) in summmer 2021. The most important lesson I learned was the joy of working with high caliber people. During that time, I gradually handled more responsibilities. This taught me a lot about teamwork, journalism, getting things done, and the benefits of being a generalist. I was fortunate to produce/guest appear on several episodes, including [BTS](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/28/1021968141/bts-the-band-that-moves-the-economy), [anime](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/30/1042060699/japanese-anime-made-in-china), [China antitrust](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/25/1031074795/chinas-big-tech-crackdown) and Stripe Atlas (stay tuned). Please give them a listen!

I also really enjoy my experience as a Chinese/math TA. It is difficult to become highly effective in these subjects, but it opens my eyes to the subtle nuances and ways to communicate in terms of words and emotions. The experience also exposes how different we learn, handle challenges, and work together. I will have a lot of fond moments to remember about my time in college!


### Projects

I enjoy random projects. They are fun. We all need a little bit of fun on top of the daily grind. I am working on the following things right now. Progress will be updated every month. 

I have two long-term projects:
* [Chinese blog](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIxMzg5Mjk0Mg==&mid=2247484627&idx=1&sn=ab016fed61e0c77cca82fbcdf51387c4&chksm=97aeaef2a0d927e40c0c108c7d2a1722107e82b605f2e0519822e06feb21bcb53658b2f9bbb1&token=470111712&lang=zh_CN#rd) on Wechat (michaelscorner); I started in summer 2019 and it's been growing steadily since then, now close to 1000 readers. 
* [English blog](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/) I started in Spring 2021 and consitently write every week. Particularly good ones will be shared here.

I also have some short-term projects (which I rotate based on current interests): 
* A primer on mathematical growth curves (as part of my senior dissertation). I will release individual chapters in early March, starting with exponential growth and ending with fractal growth. There will likely be "explainer" blog posts on each concept I find interesting and relevant to our daily lives.
* My love for See's Candies, which leads me to trace [the business](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lO9OGr2hqQ3SiGpks5O6u4NkhbVFXdFY8bTdbTu3lEQ/edit?usp=sharing) and [its financial data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12RgKTHFlFf_Bj8IS3gGPwYSwxKyI41M6c7fYyZ78phQ/edit?usp=sharing). 
* Fringe entreprenuership, [my vision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12W6_3AliJwf3Axs8aIYrcmEdBOePt2AVLJ-5K4GPHRM/edit?usp=sharing) for a future of people doing things they love outside of a full-time job
* Statistical analysis on scientific progress. Here is a link to [my repository](https://github.com/himichaelhe/citationgames). You can run the files in RStudio. I am writing a companion essay on this topic this summer 2022.
* A secret project on K-pop with some of the biggest fan accounts on Twitter (who are beyond supportive for what I have in mind).

Once I complete my senior thesis, I will have more time to dabble with web dev, Rails, and Python. They are things I really want to learn, but cannot focus given my current commitments.

### Writing

I started a [blog](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/) in March 2021. It's been an [incredible experience](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/240-days-later-5280bc41). Please share with people if you like it. It means a lot to me!

You can find my favorite posts from 2021 [here](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/2021-top-posts-68f6875f). The good news is 2022 will be even better, because I'm slowly finding my mojo. Writing what you want to write is really fun. I wish more people can give it a try. 

Here are some of my favorite pieces that survived my friend/editor Samuel's scruitny: 

* [Why Kids Hate Writing](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/why-kids-hate-writing-0df7b6ad)

* [Fast And Thoughtful](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/fast-and-thoughtful-aa453b11)

I will probably write more about college, language learning, k-pop, and books I love in the foreseeable future. Please stay tuned.

### Bio

I spent my childhood in Shanghai and moved to California in 6th grade. I'd love to share some of those stories if you are interested. At some point I will write down a few traveling experiences that changed me for the better. 

P.S: I love In-N-Out. My go-to order is cheeseburger with grilled onions, well-done fries, and a cup of water. 

### Bookshelf

There are more books than I can ever finish. It's both a blessing and a curse. 

Here are books I want to [reread](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/start-rereading-38c867e9) in 2022. They have shaped my thinking process in various ways.

* Poor Charlie's Almanack: the life operating system
* Range: the benefits of being a generalist
* Influence: the best way to operate as a human being
* Zero to One: how to think for yourself
* The Evolution of Everything: the bigger forces in the world
* The Four Loves: the value of friendship and kindness
* The Power Broker: on hubris, on genius, and on human nature
