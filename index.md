## Hi, I'm Michael He

I live in Los Angeles. I am a math major at Pomona College, graduating in summer 2022.

My current priority is active listening. A non-exhaustive list of my favorite things includes Bach, 1960's jazz, manga, dogs, investing, tennis, and history.

### Writing

I started a [blog](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/) in March 2021. It's been an [incredible experience so far](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/240-days-later-5280bc41). Please subscribe and share with people if you like it. It means a lot!

You can find my top posts from 2021 [here](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/2021-top-posts-68f6875f).

### Brief Bio

I spent the first half of my life in Shanghai and the second half in California. One day I will write about [my early life story like this](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1025089196292157440?lang=en). My most formative years are indeed formative.

Traveling and reading are two great ways to learn about this world. I'm blessed to do both at an early age. Tokyo gave me the first taste of freedom. The Bay Area showed me how driven and smart people can get. And Hawaii taught me the importance of culture, care, and gratitude. 

By the way, I'm a big In-N-Out fan! I usually order a cheeseburger with grilled onions, well-done fries, animal style, and free water. Inflation sucks, but at least In-N-Out keeps a good meal under ten bucks!

As a humanities turned STEM student, I never imagined to learn to code. But here I am, writing one line after another on VS Code and R Studio. I'm not passionate about coding, but I like it a lot. One thing I will do is to connect the digital world with the physical world, especially in "unglamorous" places like agriculture, logistics, and mundane work. My story of becoming a math major is also quite representative of my life so far - learning whatever that interests me at the time while staying curious about other things. 

This past summer I worked at NPR's [Planet Money Indicator podcast](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money). I learned a lot, especially the joy of working with and learning from high caliber people. I was fortunate to contribute to and produce several stories, such as this one on [BTS](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/28/1021968141/bts-the-band-that-moves-the-economy), [anime](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/30/1042060699/japanese-anime-made-in-china), [China antitrust](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/25/1031074795/chinas-big-tech-crackdown) and Stripe Atlas (please stay tuned). Go give them a listen.

### Bookshelf
