I like doing projects. I am working on the following things right now. 

I have three long-term projects:

Here is a list of other projects I've done:

### Writing

Writing what you want to write is really fun. I wish more people can give it a try. 

Here are some of my favorite pieces:

* [Why Kids Hate Writing](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/why-kids-hate-writing-0df7b6ad)
* [Stop Being Jealous Of WeChat](https://michaelhe.me/wechat)
* [The Trust Battery](https://michaelhe.me/trustbattery)
* [Tender Lightness](https://michaelhe.me/tender)
* [New Year Old Me](https://michaelhe.me/oldme)
* [Build Momentum](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/build-momentum-ab789180)
* [Don't Read Everything Don't Do Everything](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/don-t-read-everything-don-t-do-everything-b60c7ebb)
* [Fast And Thoughtful](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/fast-and-thoughtful-aa453b11)

Here are some non-essay things to read:
* [Michael's San Gabriel Valley Eating Guide](https://michaelhe.me/626)
* [Lessons For New College Students](https://michaelhe.me/firstyear)
* [Lessons For 18 Year Old Michael](https://michaelhe.me/collegelessons)

I no longer have the abundant energy necessary to plan out topics ahead of time. Let's have serendipity play a larger role.

### Bookshelf

I strive to read everyday. One thing I learned over time is to never stop reading and do whatever it takes to make that happen. I quit reading boring or unsubstantial things very quickly. I often switch reading materials to maintain energy and interest. And I don't limit myself to reading books or articles, anything is fair game (even music lyrics or web novels).

The napkin math is as follows: reading 20 pages a day equals 600 pages each month, which is about two full-length books. That equals two dozen books read a year, which is well above the general public. Chances are you read even more than that, considering these 20 pages are largely for leisure, not for work. 

Things pile up really quickly. That's the magic of life.

### Links, Links, Links!!
