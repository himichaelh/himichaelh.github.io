## Hi, I'm Michael He

I live in Los Angeles. I am a math major at Pomona College, but I spend most of my time on random things - investing, business, China, food, fermentation, economic growth, anime/manga, jazz, Bach, walking, Roman history ...

I haven't made up my mind on most things in the world. In fact, I need to work hard to have an [opinion](https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/).

This summer I will work at NPR's [Indicator podcast](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money). Please give it a listen! I am learning programming and its tangential fields very slowly. It's important to keep my effort fun and sustainable, since I'm not desperate for a software development job.

You can email me [here](mailto:michaelhe@hey.com).
You can read my thoughts [here](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/).
You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hi_michaelh). I need a better Twitter handle, someone please help.

### Brief Bio

I grew up in Shanghai. I have been in California since 2011. One day I will write about [my story](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1025089196292157440?lang=en) from 2010 to 2020. For now, let's just leave my bio at In-N-Out.

### Writings

I write on [HEY World](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/). I process my thoughts there. I enjoy free writing and HEY makes it privately sharable. When I feel confident about my pieces, I will bundle them into a newsletter like [this](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/28-days-later-b7ca0493). Particularly good essays may get shared on Twitter, such as [this one](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/why-kids-hate-writing-0df7b6ad) retweeted by my writing role models Paul Graham and Jason Fried. I will also share my writing journey from time to time, for example this one on [rewriting](https://world.hey.com/michaelhe/start-rewriting-bc92144b).

You can take a look at my [Chinese blog here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/cQC_9Z_Jj_e2i0Uhuiazbw). This is a story of my good fortunes. My WeChat account is michaelscorner.

### Bookshelf

I will upload book reviews in the future. For now, see my recent reads and favorites [here](https://www.zeneca.io/michaelhe).

I have some books that are impossible to throw out:
* The Analects
* Poor Charlie's Almanack
* Warren Buffett's Letters to Shareholders
* Books by Seneca
* Records of the Grand Historian

Go read some books. It's fun.
